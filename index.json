[{"content":"Virtual Machines Virtual machines have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to provide a secure and isolated environment for running software and applications. In this article, we will introduce the concept of virtual machines for beginners and discuss how they can improve security and privacy for both work and personal use.\nWhat is a Virtual Machine? A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer, running an operating system and applications in an isolated environment. It allows users to run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical computer, without interfering with one another. Virtual machines can be created using a virtual machine software such as VMware, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V.\nUse Cases for Virtual Machines Safe Browsing A virtual machine can be used to browse the web safely, as it provides a secure and isolated environment for testing out unknown websites, software or applications. In case the website or application is infected with malware or viruses, the virtual machine can be discarded without affecting the main operating system or other software on the physical computer.\nDevelopment and Testing Virtual machines can be used by developers to create multiple development environments, each with a specific set of requirements for testing their applications. With VMs, developers can test their software in different operating systems and configurations without having to purchase and set up multiple physical computers.\nData Protection By using a virtual machine, you can store sensitive data and information within the virtual machine environment. In case the physical computer is compromised, the virtual machine can be encrypted or password protected, thereby ensuring that the data stored within is secure.\nMultiple Operating Systems A virtual machine allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical computer, allowing you to test out different software or applications that may be incompatible with your current operating system. For instance, a Windows user can create a Linux VM to test out Linux applications or vice versa.\nConclusion Virtual machines are becoming increasingly popular, thanks to their ability to provide an isolated and secure environment for running software and applications. They have a wide range of use cases, from safe browsing to software testing, data protection, and running multiple operating systems on a single computer. Virtual machines are relatively easy to set up and use, and even beginners can get started with them with just a little bit of practice. If you value security and privacy in your work and personal use, then learning about virtual machines is a must.\n","permalink":"https://thesimplelinuxtheory.github.io/posts/virtual-machines/","summary":"Virtual Machines Virtual machines have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to provide a secure and isolated environment for running software and applications.

I am neither a software developer nor a web developer. Linux\u0026rsquo;s security and stability appeal to me as a computer enthusiast. I began using Linux with Manjaro after reading an article stating that Manjaro OS always has the most recent applications and is extremely versatile. I had a steep learning curve because I was unfamiliar with Linux at the time and there was little online information on the system. Not to mention that the Manjaro community does not welcome beginners.\nI went distro hunting and discovered Ubuntu, a Linux operating system based on Debian with a beginner-friendly interface. Ubuntu became my primary operating system at that time, and the learning process was easier than Manjaro. The community was welcoming and patient, there is a wealth of knowledge available online, and my computer functions flawlessly.\nThe most essential factor in my decision to move to Linux was Windows\u0026rsquo; lack of security and privacy. Once I felt comfortable with Ubuntu and Linux in general, I went distro-hopping again in search of a distribution that was more safe, stable, and cutting-edge than Ubuntu. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, Ubuntu is amazing, but Fedora is my new passion.\nFedora Silverblue 37 I utilize Fedora Silverblue 37 due to the containers feature of the system. This provides me with the security and freedom to experiment with new system components without concern of breaking anything. In addition, working within a container provides an increased level of confidentiality and anonymity.\nSilverblue 37 adds another characteristic. Podman, a docker substitute that does not require sudo access for execution. The logic is more complex than that; additional information can be found here. A second innovation is the utilization of toolbox containers, a novel method for running Fedora containers. I have toolboxes for both professional and personal items. Every toolbox has a separate browser installed.\nFedora Silverblue 37 gives me the flexibility to work in an Ubuntu or other Podman-supported distribution. Kasm Workspaces is something I utilize frequently for secure browsing and viewing my email without concern of a virus or other assault on my primary computer.\nConclusion Fedora Silverblue 37 provides me with a great deal of flexibility to use my computer as I consider appropriate. Adds the level of protection I\u0026rsquo;ve always desired in an operating system and also protects my privacy. This system\u0026rsquo;s stability and efficiency are flawless; it\u0026rsquo;s a pleasure to use.

You may, however, select any theme from Hugo Themes; just be sure to read each theme\u0026rsquo;s instructions before commencing and make any necessary adjustments. Use Windows, Mac OS, or a Linux distribution other than Ubuntu to complete the project. Remember that specific commands will vary. Refer to the quick start guide on the Hugo website to install Hugo on your computer. I feel accomplished after completing this work because of the grade complexity and required procedures.\nI am still a beginner user of the website and occasionally make silly mistakes. The most difficult component of building a website is tailoring it to my specifications, which will need me to seek out further information or potentially contact the theme\u0026rsquo;s developer. For me, this is not the end; I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that there is always more to learn in this area. I intend to take my time, but I feel it will be time well spent.\nInstalling Hugo All right, let\u0026rsquo;s get started: Now, let\u0026rsquo;s determine whether Hugo is installed on our system, install it, and then determine its version\u0026hellip;\n$ sudo dnf update $ sudo dnf install hugo $ hugo version hugo v0.98.0+extended linux/amd64 Optional I\u0026rsquo;m generating the necessary directories to maintain system order.

Two more repositories must be created. The first one is titled blog; scroll down and press the create button. Let\u0026rsquo;s create another repository, but this time it must include your username. In my particular case, thesimplelinuxtheory.github.io. This will be the URL for the webpage.\nDuring the process of publishing my local site to GitHub, I encounter multiple issues. Because of racism, a command originally called as master was renamed to main. You are now aware if an error is detected. The system also requested me to input my username and password for GitHub. You must generate a token for the password. Log in to your GitHub account, go to settings, scroll down, and on the right, you\u0026rsquo;ll see developer settings; click in and then follow the on-screen instructions. I was unable to use the beta token. Once the token has been generated, copy it and save it in a convenient area, as you will need it several times.\nThe tutorials I was following did not include this method. Due to a variety of variables, the majority of the time I\u0026rsquo;m doing something, it\u0026rsquo;s always something different. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;m working in a container, because I\u0026rsquo;m missing software on my system, or because I lack experience.

The main reason for the switch was that Linux offered me more safety, privacy, and control over my system. I initially started with Manjaro, but I found the experience to be too challenging due to the harsh community towards beginners, lack of tutorials, and overwhelming nature of the operating system.\nUbuntu Undeterred, I decided to give Ubuntu a try, and it was a much better fit. The Ubuntu community was more welcoming, and there were many more resources available, such as YouTube tutorials and web forums. I found that it was much easier to find software that worked well with my PC, and my experience with Ubuntu was much smoother overall.\nFedora SilverBlue Eventually, I decided to switch to Fedora Silverblue 37, which has been an amazing experience. This operating system is even more secure and agile, and I love the fact that it has a system immutable. Within Fedora Silverblue 37, I have been able to keep my workflow contained within specific environments using containers through Fedora toolboxes. This has allowed me to avoid any potential conflicts or errors that could arise and has made my workflow more organized and efficient.\nContainers Working with containers has also opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me, as I have been able to experiment with different Linux distributions at the same time using tools like Podman. I have found that Podman is incredibly useful for managing containers in a secure and flexible way and that it has a lot of useful features, such as the ability to run containers as non-root users.\nIn addition to containers, Linux has introduced me to the world of virtual machines, which has opened up a whole new realm of possibilities. I have used VMs to run multiple instances of Ubuntu and experiment with different configurations without risking damage to my main operating system. Running a copy of Windows in a virtual machine has allowed me to run Windows-specific applications that I need for work without compromising the security of my Linux operating system.\nConclusion Finally, Linux has helped me learn about Proxmox, which is a powerful virtualization manager that has helped me enhance my home lab. Proxmox is a web-based interface that allows me to manage multiple virtual machines and containers from a single, easy-to-use dashboard. It has a lot of advanced features, such as live migration and high availability, which make it an ideal tool for running servers and managing complex networks.\nAll of these experiences and tools that I have learned through Linux have allowed me to grow and become more comfortable with technology.
