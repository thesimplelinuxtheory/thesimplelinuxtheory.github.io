[{"content":"Why People Don’t Use Linux? Linux is a powerful and versatile operating system that has been around for decades. It is known for its security, stability, and open-source nature, making it a top choice for developers, system administrators, and tech-savvy users. However, despite its numerous advantages over Windows, Linux has not gained widespread adoption among the general public. In this blog, we will discuss some of the reasons why Linux is not more widely used.\nLack of User-Friendly Interface: One of the biggest challenges faced by Linux is its user interface, which can be intimidating and confusing for many people. Unlike Windows and MacOS, Linux does not have a standard graphical user interface (GUI), which can make it difficult for beginners to navigate and use.\nLimited Software Availability: Although Linux has a vast repository of open-source software, it still lacks some popular applications that are only available on Windows. For example, some popular games, design software, and multimedia tools may not be available for Linux, which can make it difficult for users to switch to Linux.\nLack of Commercial Support: Linux is a community-driven project, and its development is largely supported by volunteers. This means that users may not have access to commercial support or technical assistance, which can make it difficult for them to resolve issues.\nIncompatibility with Hardware: Linux is known for its ability to run on a wide range of hardware platforms, but it can still be difficult for users to find compatible hardware and drivers for their systems.\nFear of Change: Finally, many users are simply resistant to change and prefer the familiar interface and software of Windows. They may also be intimidated by the perceived difficulty of learning a new operating system.\nIn conclusion, although Linux offers numerous advantages over Windows, including security, stability, and versatility, it still faces several challenges that prevent it from being more widely adopted. However, as technology advances and Linux continues to evolve, it is likely that these challenges will be overcome, and Linux will become more accessible and user-friendly for the general public.\n","permalink":"https://thesimplelinuxtheory.github.io/posts/whypeopledontuselinux/","summary":"Why People Don’t Use Linux?

However, you can choose any theme you like from Hugo Themes; just be sure to read the instructions of each theme before beginning and make any necessary tweaks. Use Windows, Mac OS, or another Linux distro to complete this project. Remember that certain commands will be different. Refer to the Hugo website’s quick start guide to install Hugo on your computer. Due to the grade difficulty and required processes, I feel accomplished after completing this task.\nI am still learning and occasionally making mistakes on the website. The most challenging aspect of constructing a website is customizing it for my needs, which will need me to seek out further information or possibly contact the theme’s developer. For me, this is not the end; I’ve discovered that there is more and more to learn in this area. I shall take my time, but I believe it is time well spent.\nInstall All right, let’s get started: Now, let’s check if we have Hugo in our system, install and then check the version again…\n$ sudo dnf update $ sudo dnf install hugo $ hugo version hugo v0.98.0+extended linux/amd64 I’m creating the required directories to maintain system order. You can skip this step and simply store the file wherever you like on your computer.\n$ cd Documents $ mkdir Projects \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd Projects $ mkdir blog \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd blog Go to GitHub and establish an account if you are a new user, or log in if you already have one. You must create two additional repositories. The first one was titled blog; scroll down and press the create button. Let’s establish another repository, but this time it must have your username. In my situation, username.github.io. This will be the web page’s address. If you have a domain, the next step is to visit netfly; however, that is outside the scope of this article.\nDuring the process of pushing my local site to GitHub, I face a number of problems. Due to racism, a command formerly known as master was renamed to main. If you find an error, you are now aware. The system also required me to enter my GitHub username and password. For the password you’ll need to generate a token . It’s was found in a web article. To obtain your token, log in to your GitHub account, navigate to settings, scroll down, and on the right side you’ll see developer settings; click in and then follow the on-screen instructions. The beta token did not work for me. Once the token has been generated, copy it and store it in an easily accessible location, as you will need it multiple times.\nThis procedure did not appear in the tutorials I was following. Due to various factors, the majority of the time I’m doing something, it’s always something unique. Perhaps it’s because I’m working inside a container, because I’m missing software on my system, or because I lack experience. For anyone experiencing this problem, you are saved here.\n$ hugo new site . $ git init $ git remote add origin \u0026#34;clone the repository you just created\u0026#34; $ git pull origin main # create a file .gitignore and write \u0026#34;public/\u0026#34; save and close $ nano .gitignore $ git add . $ git status $ git commit -m \u0026#34;initial commit\u0026#34; $ git push -u origin master $ cd themes/ #Look for the theme you like and clone it here $ git clone \u0026#34;your theme\u0026#34; # Activate your theme here. Follow instructutions for your desire theme. $ nano config.yml $ hugo server -w #Now your website is up locally. Follow instructions for your theme must of the times is localhost:1313 Locally, our website is up and running; congrats! I was receiving a different address each time I deployed this theme, as opposed to the usual localhost:1313.\nConclusion: Part 1 of this series has come to a close; it may have taken long time, but you are finally free to experiment with and modify your website as you see fit. Keep in mind that there are fascinating new discoveries to be made at every turn. In the next part, we’ll learn how to deploy a local website to GitHub Pages. Next comes the exciting part; enjoy yourself, and keep in mind that learning is a process, not a destination.\n","permalink":"https://thesimplelinuxtheory.github.io/projects/hugowebsites/","summary":"Static Websites This project was created using Fedora SilverBlue on a toolbox container, and the theme I chose is Hugo-Coder.

As you’re probably aware, I am a technophile with limited knowledge of technology and software. I intend to create a setting in which beginners learning Linux and other topics do not feel lost.\nLinux was initially introduced to me after viewing a YouTube video by ChrisTitus and DT-DistroTube. Despite my failure to absorb anything while repeatedly viewing a video, these two men gave me the confidence to start experimenting with Linux. It was annoying to interrupt the video in order to research unexpected subjects. I asked help from a local computer store in order to install Linux on my computer, as I was incapable of doing so on my own.\nAfter all those days of bewilderment and sleepless hours spent searching for answers, I can now claim I have a better understanding of certain topics, but I still have a lot to learn, which is fascinating!\nIt will take time and effort to make the entire process more digestible for those who are new to Linux, but i hope that doing so will assist many people in understanding the fantastic things that can be accomplished with a better grasp of technology.\nThe first project I will publish will describe how to make a Hugo website utilizing github pages and will be released online. The procedure is tiresome for individuals unfamiliar with this setting, as well as myself. I viewed a number of YouTube lessons on Hugo, but only after many hours did I find one that I was able to successfully implement in order to create a functional website. I would like to thank Horea Porutiu for the excellent teaching, which was not intended for beginners. I documented the entire procedure with the hope that it would prove useful.\n","permalink":"https://thesimplelinuxtheory.github.io/projects/introtohugo/","summary":"Static Websites Hugo Static Websites are extraordinary!
